<h2 class="style7">Introduction about Homoeopathy :</h2>
<hr />
<p class="style6">&nbsp;Homoeopathy  is a form of alternative medicine, first proposed by German physician Samuel Hahnemann in 1796, that attempts to treat patients with heavily diluted preparations. Based on an axiom  formulated by Hahnemann which he called the law of similars preparations which cause certain symptoms in healthy individuals are  given as the treatment for patients exhibiting similar symptoms. Homeopathic remedies are prepared by serial dilution  with shaking by forceful striking, which homeopaths term after each dilution under the assumption that this increases the effect  of the treatment. Homeopaths call this process. Dilution often continues until none of the original substance remain

  <br />
  Homoeopathy sees disease as a dynamic expression of the disturbances of the harmony and rhythm of the vital force.this rhythm may be so disturbed as to increase  the pace or lower the vitality , and that in itself either raises or lowers the reaction of body , the mind and the sprit. Any 
  disturbance of this vital force immediatly shows itself in lack of harmony through the outword manifestations of  our beings ;in other words ,symptoms : and we become sick.</p>
<p class="style6">The vital force must first be set in order by the appropriate remedy .This is the aim of homoeopathy.Homoeopathy only stimulates the patient's own reaction powers and by so doing to bring about a cure. Disease is only the rebellion of the vital force against noxias agents inimical to life, and cure only comes from the stimulated reaction of the vital force against disease.</p>
<p class="style6">The vital force is an influence which direct all the aspects of life in the organism. It adapts to enviromental influences , it animates the emotional life of the individual, it provides thought and creativity , and it conducts spiritual inspiration.</p>
