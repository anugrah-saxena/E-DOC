        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">For over 3000 years, <strong><em>Ayurveda</em></strong>, the ancient  science of living, has addressed itself to the fundamental principles  of good health and longetivity. It has developed a tradition of <strong><em>ayurvedic medicines</em></strong> and a system of treatment based in the inherent ability of the human  body to rejuvenate, to heal and to restore its natural balance.</a></li>
        </ul>

      <li><a class="MenuBarItemSubmenu" href="#">Advantage</a>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">It is preventive, protective, health primitive and curative in nature.  At the same time herbal remedies are self contained, and nutritive  rendering them harmless and non toxic. This provides a constructive  approach against destructive forces.</a> </li>
          <li><a href="#">Ayurveda is not man made but is believed to be divine gift. It is for  us to study, seek, search and take the benefits from the treasure of  knowledge.</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Ayurveda is mainly based on herbs, plants, flowers, fruits, vegetables  and all vegetation that grows around us in plenty. It is our native  system based on the peculiar indian conditions. Further whatever is  available on our own country is bound to be more suitable in creating  good health to us rather than borrowed knowledge as well as materials.  Charaka samhita stresses the same point.</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#" class="MenuBarItemSubmenu">Disease Types</a>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#"><strong>Samanyaj Vyadhi:</strong><br />
          Samanyaj vyadhi arises when there  is an imbalance of one or all the Doshas. It is caused due to  disequilibrium of any one, two or three Doshas. For instance, Anemia  can be caused due to the disequilibrium of either of Vata, Pitta or  Kapha Dosha or all of them.<br />
          </a></li>
          <li><a href="#"><strong>Nanatmaj:</strong> <br />
          This disease is caused due to disequilibrium of one particular Dosha.  Some of the most common nanatmaj vyadhis are grudhrasi (sciatica),  Kamala (jaundice), Medorog (obesity), each being caused due to the  vitiation of Vata, Pitta, Kapha Doshas, respectively.<br />
          </a></li>
          <li><a href="#"><strong>Agantuj:</strong> <br />
          Agantuj vyadhi occurs, when the patient suffers from a disease that is  cause due to the entrance of a foreign body, into the system. <br />
          </a></li>
          <li><a href="#"><strong>Nijroga:</strong> <br />
          A person suffers from nijroga vyadhi, when all the three Doshas become i</a></li>
          <li><a href="#"><strong>Manas:</strong> <br />
          A person tends to suffers manas vyadhi, when the Doshas interfere with the functioning of his/her nervous system.</a></li>
          <li><a href="#"><strong>Sadhya:</strong> <br />
          Diseases that can be cured are often referred to as sadhya, in  ayurveda. Sadhya is further divided into following two categories -  Sukhasadhya and Kruchchhasadhya. Sukhasadhya refers to diseases, which  are easily curable within a short span of time. On the other hand,  Kruchchhasadhya are those diseases, which are curable with difficulty.</a></li>
          <li><a href="#"><strong>Asadhya:</strong><br />
          Asadhya, as the name suggests, is exactly  opposite to sadhya. A disease is referred to as asadhya in Ayurveda, if  it is incurable. Asadhya is further divided into two categories - Yapya  and Anukarma. In yapya, the treatments or remedies applied afford  relief to the patient, but within a short span, relapse again. Such  type of disease can be controlled only at the time of medication. On  the other hand, Anukarma is irredeemable, that is, remedies applied to  it, in no way, give relief to the patient.<br />
          </a></li>
          <li><a href="#"><strong>Aadi- Bala Pravritta:</strong> <br />
          Genetically predisposed diseases are often referred to as Aasi-bala pravritta, in Ayurveda.<br />
          </a></li>
          <li><a href="#"><strong>Janma- Bala:</strong> <br />
          The congenital diseases are known as janma-bala in Ayurveda. </a></li>
          <li><a href="#"><strong>Sanghata-bala:</strong> <br />
          If the disease is traumatic, then it is referred to as sanghata-bala in Ayurveda. <br />
