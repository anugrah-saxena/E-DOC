<p align="justify" class="style4">Uncontrolled   diabetes can be extremely dangerous, resulting in loss of vision, damage to the   nerves, blood vessels, kidney and increased risk of heart attack. Diabetes cannot   be cured but it can be controlled either by diet alone, oral medication or by   administering insulin. Some complications of diabetes are hard to control and   can even lead to premature death.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><strong>Adverse effects</strong>  </p>
</p>
<ul class="style4">
  <li>
    <p align="justify"> High levels of glucose in the blood causes diabetic neuropathy. It can cause damage   to the blood vessels supplying the nerves and the nerves itself causing gradual   loss of sensation primarily in hands and feet which may extend up the limbs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">It   causes damage to the blood vessels in the light-sensitive retina at the back of   the eye, which affects both the eyes and if left untreated can result in loss   of vision and blindness. People with diabetes should have their eye examined yearly. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">Damage   to the blood vessels in the kidneys and destroys the kidneys function of removing   wastes and excess water from the body. Symptoms include vomiting, breathlessness,   drowsiness etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">It can cause hypoglycemia (a disorder   in which the blood sugar falls to abnormally low levels) by the gradual build   up of glucose lowering drugs in the blood or excessive dose of insulin in relation   to food intake. New born baby of a diabetic mother can also develop hypoglycemia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"> Bacteria thrives on glucose rich blood and urine, people with uncontrolled diabetes   are more prone to urinary tract infection.<br />
      It can cause chemical imbalance   in the blood causing nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion etc. It effects   type I diabetes patients. </p>

<span class="style4"><strong>Type I diabetes :</strong> This usually  requires life-long insulin therapy along with the control in diet. This replaces the insulin absent in the body  due to non production of insulin by the pancreas. This  insulin therapy maintains constant low background levels of insulin with  peaks at mealtimes when glucose enters the blood. Insulin injections are available in  various forms including short-acting, long-acting and combination of both forms.  Short-acting insulin are take 15-30 minutes before mealtimes while  longer-acting insulin are taken once or twice a day. 
</p>
</span>
<p align="justify" class="style4"><strong>Type II diabetes :</strong> The  blood-glucose level can be controlled by exercising regularly and following a  healthy diet to maintain ideal weight. Sometimes the drugs may be needed to  stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin or control your blood sugar. You may be  prescribed anti- diabetic drugs such as sulfonylureas, which stimulate the  pancreas to release insulin or metformin, which helps body tissues to absorb  glucose. You may also be given acarbose, which slows the absorption of glucose  from the intestine and prevents fluctuations in the blood level. If antidiabetic  drugs do not prove to be effective, insulin may be used to treat. </p>

Exercise   can help to <a >control your weight</a>, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce cardiovascular   risk factors and lower your blood sugar level.

<span class="style4">The exercise plan will vary depending on interest, age, general health, level   of physical fitness, the type of diabetics and health problems related with diabetics.   Exercise is safest and most effective for people with type 2 diabetes. Aerobic   exercise is mostly recommended for diabetic patients. It helps to control diabetics   directly, by improving your body's use of sugar as well as indirectly by facilitating   weight loss. Examples of aerobic exercise include walking, jogging, aerobic dance   or bicycling. If you have problems with the nerves in your feet or legs, exercises   that won't put stress on your feet, like swimming, bicycling, rowing or chair   exercises are recommended. Regular, vigorous exercise helps insulin work   optimally and regulates sugar level.

<span class="style4">Excess consumption of <a  >alcohol</a> is harmful as it may lower blood glucose levels   and cause weight gain. Smoking is very harmful to diabetes patients, because it   increases the risk of long-term complications. Foot care is important because   diabetes can increase the risk of skin infections and ulcers on the feet. You   must clean your feet daily and if a sore develop on your feet, consult the doctor   promptly. Diabetes patients have an increased risk of high blood pressure, so   regular monitoring is important.
